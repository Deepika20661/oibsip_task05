# 📈 Sales Prediction using Machine Learning 💰

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting sales revenue based on advertising spending across different media channels. 📊📢

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Advertising.csv`, which includes the following features:
- 📺 **TV** - Advertising budget spent on TV ads.
- 📻 **Radio** - Advertising budget spent on radio ads.
- 📰 **Newspaper** - Advertising budget spent on newspaper ads.
- 💵 **Sales** - The total sales revenue (Target variable).

## 📂 Project Files

- 📜 `Sales_Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- 📁 `Advertising.csv` - Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing relationships between advertising budgets and sales.
3. **Model Training** - Implementing regression models such as:
   - Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
4. **Model Evaluation** - Measuring performance using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
5. **Prediction & Insights** - Using the trained model to estimate future sales based on advertising spend.

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🎯 Results

The trained model accurately predicts sales revenue based on advertising spending. 🌟
- Key insights on which advertising channel contributes most to sales.
- Performance metrics help select the best predictive model.
- Visualizations provide deeper understanding of feature importance.
